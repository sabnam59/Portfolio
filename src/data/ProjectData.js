        "food ordering web application designed to provide a seamless online ordering experience for users. The platform allows customers to browse restaurants, explore menus, add items to a cart, and place orders for delivery or pickup. I built this project with a focus on clean UI/UX, real-time cart updates, and secure user authentication. On the admin side, restaurant owners can manage their menu, track incoming orders, and update restaurant details through a dedicated dashboard. The project leverages modern technologies like React for the front end, Node.js and Express for the backend, and MongoDB for data management. It also includes features such as JWT-based authentication, payment integration, and responsive design for mobile and desktop devices.",
